Kevin:

in the XML possibly add what each state corresponds to, ex. 0.0: water, 1.0: fish etc
put it in a Map<Double,String> and pass it to me through Hub please

create a new neighborhood maker (?) class that Chris can access in order to dynamically change what cell type
a user has 
Chris also needs to make a method I can access so I can use an event handler to switch the neighborhoods
*note, this does not need to preserve the place the simulation is at. when the user changes from ex squares
to hexagons it just reloads the entire file.

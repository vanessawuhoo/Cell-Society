Kevin:

in the XML possibly add what each state corresponds to, ex. 0.0: water, 1.0: fish etc
put it in a Map<Double,String> and pass it to me through Hub please

create a new neighborhood maker (?) class that Chris can access in order to dynamically change what cell type
a user has 

Chris also needs to make a method I can access so I can use an event handler to switch the neighborhoods
*note, this does not need to preserve the place the simulation is at. when the user changes from ex squares
to hexagons it just reloads the entire file.

If you implement toroidal, please make a method that will allow switching between using toroidal and regular grid
neighborhoods. That way, I can add that switching functionality to the UI.

add in neighborhood types to xml
add in what state double to state name
add state double to state color
error checking
probability making
making xml
